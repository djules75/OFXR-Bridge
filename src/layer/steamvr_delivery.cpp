// One OpenVR connection for the whole process, opened at most once and

// It used to be per session, and tearing it down is what killed Assetto Corsa.
// That title recreates its OpenXR session during start-up - three times, on
// every runtime - and SteamVR ships its OpenXR runtime and its OpenVR client
// in one binary, vrclient_x64.dll. Opening a background OpenVR connection into
// that binary and then closing it leaves the next xrCreateSession through it
// dereferencing null, inside the runtime, with the layer merely forwarding the
// call. Captured with symbols: the fault is in vrclient_x64 and the only frame
// of ours below it is the downstream create.
//
// Every session create before our connection attaches succeeds and the first
// one after it dies, and when the attach happened three seconds later in one
// run the crash moved three seconds later with it. The title ran on V185,
// which is the last build with no connection at all.
//
// So the connection outlives every session. Not shutting it down is the point,
// not an oversight: VR_ShutdownInternal is what does the damage, and a
// background connection costs nothing to leave open for a process that is
// about to exit anyway.
//
// The cost is paid at the other lifecycle boundary. Outliving the session also
// means outliving the *instance*, and an application that destroys its
// XrInstance and builds another one then hangs in xrCreateInstance - in
// SteamVR, with the layer forwarding the call, the same vrclient_x64.dll and
// the same connection, one boundary over. Measured on R.E.A.L. VR, which
// probes with a throwaway instance on every launch: five runs armed at launch,
// five hangs on the second create, and no hang in any run where the connection
// had not been opened. That is what SteamVrDelivery::mark_established() is
// for - the connection still never closes, it just never opens under a session
// that was only ever a probe.
